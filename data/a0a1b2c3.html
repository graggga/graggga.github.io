<p>The hardest part of writing is wanting to express everything you concieve.</p>

<p>I write in a number of places. Some formal, others informal. All though are subject to scrutiny of being associated with what I am expected to create.</p>

<p>This is where I can hide. Take refuge from association. Allow anonymous unbridled thought to flow.</p>

<p>This won't be the place for me to unleash my innermost offensive thoughts. Maybe in the future, If I become that way inclined. For now though, it's just whatever comes to mind.</p>
