<h1>We're</h1>

<p>
  Those failing lungs.<br />
  Those widening eyes.<br />
  Pretend it isn't there.
</p>
<p>
  Pure oxygen.<br />
  Pure mind.<br />
  The smoke, the fibres,<br />
  the black coffee you've always drunk.
</p>
<p>
  That uncontrolled temper.<br />
  Hide it from the children.<br />
  That misunderstood depression.<br />
  Hide it from yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Your tinkerer life.<br />
  Your weathered skin.<br />
  Those trinkets, those gadgets, those toys.<br />
  Press that button again.
</p>
<p>
  You built and destroyed your empires.<br />
  You wither and burn to dust.<br />
  No funeral. No closure.<br />
  We remain.
